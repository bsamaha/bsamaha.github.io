I have over 5 years of professional experience where I have worn obtained many job titles. More recently, I have been focusing on mastering data science and machine learning techniques. I am an all-around problem solver who loves to find simple, elegant solutions to complicated problems. <br/>
<br/>
I love to wrangle data and squeeze insights out of it. However, my experience has taught me that numbers do not always translate perfectly to real life. It is deciphering these boundaries, between theoretical and actual, where I love to work.

All models are wrong, but some models are useful.

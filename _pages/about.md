title: "About Me"
---


I have over 5 years of professional experience where I have obtained many job titles. To name a few, Project Manager, SCADA Database Admin, Operations Engineer, Financial Analyst, and more. More recently, I have been focusing on mastering the art of data science and machine learning. I am an all-around problem solver who loves to find simple, elegant solutions to complicated problems. <br/>
<br/>
I love wrangling data and mining insights out of it. I love to get lost in the technical exploration of a new data set. However, my experience has taught me that numbers do not always translate perfectly to real life. It is deciphering these boundaries, between theoretical and actual, where I love to work. 
<br/>
<br/>
My favorite maxim is all models are wrong, but some models are useful.

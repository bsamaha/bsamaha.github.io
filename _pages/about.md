I have over 5 years of professional experience where I have worn obtained many job titles. More recently, I have been focusing on mastering data science and machine learning techniques. I am an all-around problem solver who loves to find simple, elegant solutions to complicated problems. 

I love to wrangle data to squeeze insights out of it. However, it is important my experience has taught me that numbers do not always translate perfectly to real life. It is these situations where my strength in communication allows me to translate highly technical jargon from a subject matter expert to a less technically inclined client.
